This year I was lucky enough to attend yet another time the [devoxx](https://devoxx.com) conference. Here are what I saw/felt especially in regards to the my [previous visit](/an-overview-of-devoxx-2013).

## Java
This year the conference was a lot more about java. There was some sessions for other stuff too but you did not have these 24 session for angularjs anymore.

As it was about java, it was ofcourse about java8 and it's new features. So, as you may know lambdas have been introduced to java8 and this alone is enough to start building a lot more features on top of the platform.

So along with the lambdas, we had streams and a refined collections api that allows a more functional way of programming. 

Having heard so much about lambda/streams, here is my thoughts. The feature bring easyness and beuty to the language mostly by reducing boilerplate code. No one likes boilerplate but remember that this boilerplate is information/documentation to the user. Therefore I would suggest to make use of it with extreme caution as it is really easy to missuse it in the name of coolness. So please have some second thought before you go ahead and refine your api.

## Reactive programming

Well, there is nothing new here as [Vlad said][devoxx-borat-nothing-new] but even with a delay of some years reactive programming becomes a trend to Java to (an in software engineering in general). There where some libraries for reactive prgramming before but lambdas again can make the existing apis much more fluent.

## Docker

I do not thing that there are much to say for this topic. [Docker][docker] can be described as a very light weight linux base vm. Everybody seems to be using it and it looks like it is a matter of time that you'll be using it. I do not thing that there is any question regarding the benefits of using it and therefor just go for it as soon as possible.

As a side note. I do not know if it is java developers disliking system programming, but I did not heard a single thing regarding the background of the tool. It is a success story for [Google's golang] but nobody felt like mentioning it.

## Google, voxxed.com and others

Speaking of google, it's presance this year to the conference was really quite. The keynote was about material design, something that was less to no interest to the developers. I do not know though who an audience accustomed to backwards compatibility would feel like to the news that the [last years hot topic](https://angularjs.org/) will be a [new thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNmWybAyBHI) with no migration path.

Apart from that Microsoft's target was once more Azure marketing and nothing more which is again a little bit sad considering the [changes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2014/11/14/how-the-worm-turns-microsoft-open-sources-net/) that made public during the devoxx days.

Finally this years devoxx had more non programming related stuff. A bunch of startup related stuff among with a talk regarding [creativity](http://thecreativedose.com/) by the Chief Creativity Evangelist (cool title) named Denise Jacobs. The talk was too US for me, but still a good addition to the conference.
