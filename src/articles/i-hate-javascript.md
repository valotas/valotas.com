You know, you hear about a really cool project where you can work on stuff that you always wanted to and at the end they tell you that it will be web based.

## The bytecode of the web
Well, I could just copy and paste here all the wierd thing that javascript has and makes it sooo special. Instead you can just have a look at the following links

- l1
- l2

The problem though is, that based on the fact that this programming language (I know some do not like the term programming, but spare with me a little bit) is running on the browser, it has became the de facto standart for anything on the web. There are people trying to tackle that down by providing alternative languages, but goest what, in order to support all the browsers, their programming language has to compile down to... a non-programming language. Guess what is that.

One other thing that I heard is that software engineering has nothing to do with javascript. Given the fact that programmers want to be called software engineers, we ended up having some different kind of people programming in javascript. Funny enough these guys are rare and getting paid much more that an averege "proper" software engineer.

Funny enough, the most popular software engineering answers to messy solutions (I think this is code written by non software engineers) is always one. Encupsulate. You write some code that I do not like and you are not profesional enough. You encupsulate my spaghetti code as you can not rewrite it and you are awesome! Now, if you event go one step ferther and you manage to encupsulate a language that I hate to something else, you are just the man! There are quite a few peope out there that has reached this "the man" level. This means that there are some solutions available allowing you to write your code in java and have the javascript needed generated for you. 

## Vendor lockin
And this is when the fun is starting! In order to fix something, I have to fix the generated code that is encupsulated and make sure that the encupsulation layer is working like before. Not so efficient. On top of that, this is not even doable if you can not read or write javascript (that generated shitty code). So you end up trying to reach one of the "the man" guys to fix something for you.


- How do you lock yourself in to something that you can not maintain
- Are you developing functionality or just reusing it?
- Why do you trust third party libraries written on you language but not in javascript?
- Why do you push someone that you do not trust to take care of the javascript code
