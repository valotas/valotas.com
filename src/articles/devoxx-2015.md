This year's devoxx was once again an excuse to write a new blogpost.

## Before 2015
I was lucky enough to attend the two previous conderences:

- [An overview of devoxx 2013](/an-overview-of-devoxx-2013/)
- [An overview of devoxx 2014](/devoxx-2014/)

Although that can be nothing compared to other attendands, it gives me something to compare.

## tl;rd

Based on the talks I saw last two times during the univercity days, I thought it would be better to just skip them. The rest of the conference gave me a bitter sweat taste, as either I did not see anything more than I expected or my expectations were not that big because of lack of big events during this year. So let's break the thing up to smaller peaces...

## University days

As I said I did not attend them as I felt that they were too "boring" the last to years. The combination of 3 hours duration and lack of actual hands on programming, makes you wanting to change the topic as soon as possible. To given you an example, I can only remember one of these talks where the speaker managed to timebox different aspect of webdevelopment and speak for each one a couple of minites.

It can of course be my taste, as some friend of mine told me that they found the first 2 days this year much more interesting.

Anyway, keeping someone interested for 3 hours is not an easy job, and this is why the days have been named University days. The attendant should be willing to stay and filter the information he gets.

So let's get to the actual conference days...

## The bigger ever

It looks like this year's devoxx was the bigger ever. I think it was about 3500 attendees, or to put it by another way it was big enough to xxxx get rid of xxxx all neck wraps for the entrance tickets. Yes, this time there was no wrist wrap, but rather a simple neck wrap (if you were not late) with a printed bar code on it. Not that cool but for sure much faster as a process. At least this time I did not have to wait more than 3 minutes at the queque.

Apart from [Devoxx Belgium](http://www.devoxx.be/), there were also [Devoxx UK](http://www.devoxx.co.uk/), [Devoxx PL](http://www.devoxx.pl/), [Devoxx FR](http://www.devoxx.fr/) and [Devoxx MA](http://www.devoxx.ma/) along with bunch of [voxxed days](https://voxxeddays.com/), which I did not keep track of. It looks like the conference market is expanding and [Stephan](https://twitter.com/Stephan007) make use of it.

Although the bigger devoxx ever, there were no major problems with overcrouded XXXXXXXXXXXXX cinema?

## The keynotes

From the technology point of view, these were the purest ever keynotes I've ever seen. No big announcements, which was kind of expected as no ground breaking technology made it into this year's radar.

So it was mostly Stephan announcing the end of parleys and immediate use of youtube/vimeo for publishing conference videos. It is a pitty for parleys but I got the feeling that the  whole conference got a huge marketing push as speakers could reference to their talks a couple of hours after it.

Then [Mark Reinhold](http://mreinhold.org/) took the step to talk about jdk9 and mostly about modulatity.

Finally theoretical physics professor [Lawrence M. Krauss](https://twitter.com/LKrauss1) talked about how irrelevant was what we were doing at devoxx. I do not know if that is the best way to start a conference, but for sure it was the [best talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Kf2dR_SrQ) of day one.


## Lack of advertisements talks

I think my tweet says it all:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No advertising talk till now at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/devoxx2015?src=hash">#devoxx2015</a> either my filter works better or there is an improvement there!</p>&mdash; Yoryos Valotassios (@valotas) <a href="https://twitter.com/valotas/status/664743040448376832">November 12, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is in my opinion a major improvement. I can understand the need of advertisement talks but I do not see what they can bring in terms of marketing if there are only a couple of people watching them.

One of the coolest advertisement talks for example, was [The Twelve Factor app: Best Practices for Java Deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94PxlbuizCU) where you at least got a couple of usefull information regarding the [12 factor app](http://12factor.net/) (which in my opinion is 12 rule of thumbs for creating microservices) and the only advertisement was that you could deploy that super easy with heroku.
